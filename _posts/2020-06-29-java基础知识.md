## 重排序

java内存模型 [jrs-133][1]，对应的 [中文翻译][2]

由于指令重排，充分利用cpu资源，对于单线程是没有影响的，但在多线程环境下，对自身线程没有影响的重排序，可能会影响到其他线程，所以我们要对指令间约束。

关于[lazySet][3]：

> As probably the last little JSR166 follow-up for Mustang, we added a "lazySet" method to the Atomic classes (AtomicInteger, AtomicReference, etc). This is a niche method that is sometimes useful when fine-tuning code using non-blocking data structures. The semantics are that the write is guaranteed not to be re-ordered with any previous write, but may be reordered with subsequent operations (or equivalently, might not be visible to other threads) until some other volatile write or synchronizing action occurs).
>  
> The main use case is for nulling out fields of nodes in non-blocking data structures solely for the sake of avoiding long-term garbage retention; it applies when it is harmless if other threads see non-null values for a while, but you'd like to ensure that structures are eventually GCable. In such cases, you can get better performance by avoiding the costs of the null volatile-write. There are a few other use cases along these lines for non-reference-based atomics as well, so the method is supported across all of the AtomicX classes.
>
> For people who like to think of these operations in terms of machine-level barriers on common multiprocessors, lazySet provides a preceeding store-store barrier (which is either a no-op or very cheap on current platforms), but no store-load barrier (which is usually the expensive part of a volatile-write).

也就是说lazySet的效用是store-store barrier
